# VENDING-MACHINE

In this Verilog code, the vending machine offers four different cold drinks, each priced at 2 rupees. The user can select a drink using the user_selection input and insert coins using the coin_inserted signal. The vending machine dispenses the selected drink and returns any remaining balance to the user. The code uses a finite state machine to manage the different states of the vending machine.
